QUESTION THREE:
---------------
We are modeling a database for a restaurant and we have the following information from the restaurant management:

    * The are three menus: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

    * We'd like to keep track of the times a menu is served in 24-hr time:
        ** Breakfast is served from 8:00 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. (08:00 - 11:30)
        ** Lunch is served from 11:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. (11:30 - 16:30)
        ** Dinner is served from 4:30 p.m. - 10:00 p.m. (16:30-22:00)

    * The restaurant has different dishes, and they want to be able to store the name and
      description of each dish

    * We want to be able to track which dishes appear on which menu, along with the price of 
      each dish on the menu

    * Some of the dishes are served on multiple menus (so they appear on lunch and dinner, 
      for example, or on breakfast and lunch)

    * If a dish is served on multiple menus, the dish costs less earlier in the day than it
      does later in the day (ex: a dish at lunch costs less than it would at dinner).
 
Please describe the tables you would create to model these relationships and save this information in a database. Please also list the columns you would put in each table.
 
You can also list any questions you would still want to ask to clarify the data model.
