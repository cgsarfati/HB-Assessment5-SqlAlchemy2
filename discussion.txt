QUESTION ONE:
-------------
We have a model.py file with a class Brand, and that maps to a table 'brands' in a database.
 
Explain what is returned and why when we type the following: 
Brand.query.filter_by(name='Ford')
----------------------------------------------

ANSWER: A BaseQuery object is returned rather than a list of Brand objects that matches that criteria. The reason is, without .all()/.first()/.one() , you are simply typing a question rather than the answer to that question.

QUESTION TWO:
-------------
In your own words, describe what a middle table is and what type of relationship (many to one, many to many, one to one, etc.) it manages.
----------------------------------------------

ANSWER: A middle table is the table that connects two tables that have a many-to-many relationship (or more accurately, two one-to-many relationships). That table signifies unique events that connect the two tables together. For instance, in the user/ratings/movie data model we used for the ratings exercise, when we want to access information about a particular event (e.g. get the rating of a specific user rating a specific movie), we need a middle table to get that information. A middle table can have additional information about that event while an association table usually only includes foreign keys and a primary key.

QUESTION THREE:
---------------
We are modeling a database for a restaurant and we have the following information from the restaurant management:

    * The are three menus: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

    * We'd like to keep track of the times a menu is served in 24-hr time:
        ** Breakfast is served from 8:00 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. (08:00 - 11:30)
        ** Lunch is served from 11:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. (11:30 - 16:30)
        ** Dinner is served from 4:30 p.m. - 10:00 p.m. (16:30-22:00)

    * The restaurant has different dishes, and they want to be able to store the name and
      description of each dish

    * We want to be able to track which dishes appear on which menu, along with the price of 
      each dish on the menu

    * Some of the dishes are served on multiple menus (so they appear on lunch and dinner, 
      for example, or on breakfast and lunch)

    * If a dish is served on multiple menus, the dish costs less earlier in the day than it
      does later in the day (ex: a dish at lunch costs less than it would at dinner).
 
Please describe the tables you would create to model these relationships and save this information in a database. Please also list the columns you would put in each table.
 
You can also list any questions you would still want to ask to clarify the data model.
----------------------------------------------

ANSWER:

- Queries that we’ll probably make:
	- When is b/l/d served?
	- What is a dish’s name + desc?
	- Give me a list of all dishes from b/l/d and its corresponding price
	- Which menus does this dish appear?

- Assumptions:
	- 1 dish can appear in many menus
	- Many dishes can appear in 1 menu (aka dish-menu is MANY-TO-MANY aka need MIDDLE table)
	- Dish price changes depending on menu location (menu - price - dish interaction… price is middle table)
	- 3 menus though, so 3 middle tables
