# PART TWO: QUERIES
# -----------------

# Get the human with the id 2.
q1 = None

# Get the *first* animal with the species 'fish'

q2 = None

# Get all of the animals for the human with the id 5 and the animal species 'dog'
q3 = None

# Get all the animals that were born after 2015 (do not include animals without birth years).
q4 = None

# Find the humans with first names that start with 'J'

# PART THREE: FUNCTIONS
# ---------------------

# ***Do not use more than one query for each function***

# 1. Write a function, print_directory, which does not take any arguments
#    and prints out each human (once) with a list of their animals.

#    The output should look like this (with tabs to indent each animal name under
#    a human's name)

#       Human_first_name Human_last_name
#           Animal name (animal species)
#           Animal name (animal species)
#
#       Human_first_name Human_last_name
#           Animal name (animal species)

def print_directory():
    """"""
    pass

# 2. Write a function, get_animals_by_name, which takes in a string representing
#    an animal name (or part of an animal name) and *returns a list* of animals
#    whose names contain that string.

def get_animals_by_name(name):
    """"""
    pass

# 3. Write a function, find_humans_by_animal_species, which takes in an animal
#    species and *returns a list* of all of the humans who have animals of
#    that species.

def find_humans_by_animal_species(species):
